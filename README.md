# AlexaOps - Controlling AWS using Alexa
_Why? cause why not?!_

# Intro

This repo is an example implementation backed by a presentation. The idea is to create an Alexa skill, backed by AWS Lambda to control various operations.

# Usage

This skill supports the following actions:

- "How many development servers are running?"
    - `There are 3 Development servers, 1 server is offline`
- "Turn on all development servers"
    - `I have started 1 development server`
- "What is my Amazon bill?"
    - `Your current total is $5. Your itemised bill shows, Route53 - $3, DynamoDB - $2`
- "Scale my backend service to 5"
    - `I have scaled the backend service to 5 instances`
